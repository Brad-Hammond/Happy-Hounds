## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

#### Bug 1

- Both iframe youtube videos were not playing, it popped up with a playback error when I pressed the play button. Please see below code which fixed this error:

#### Original Code:

```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8ze37bhmGw?si=IESpBzkke8z6ZET_"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

#### Correct Code:

```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8ze37bhmGw?si=IESpBzkke8z6ZET_"
  title="YouTube video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

#### Bug 2

- Both youtube videos were not clickable, this was due to the height of the services section. Please see below code which fixed this:

#### Original Code:

```css
#services {
  height: 750px;
}
```

#### Correct Code:

```css
#services {
  height: 400px;
}
```

#### Bug 3

- A container was causing the screen to have a horizontal scroll bar, to fix this I applied the below code:

```css
html,
body {
  max-width: 100%;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```
